- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Cheleice
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the IT industry and anything in relation to technology.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and taking different programming language courses.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project I have uploaded to my GitHub profile is project 1. In this project we had to display a clock that we could change time. 
In this project we created a menu as well as a display that had formats in both regular time and military time. 
It was really fun coding. I had problems with aligning the clocks next to eachother.

What did you do particularly well? 
I continue to enjoy making the flowcharts.
I enjoyed creating the flowchart for our coffee project.
How we used certain shapes for each area of code. Rectangle for process.
Diamond for decision making. Parallelogram for decision making.
I need to start making flowcharts more often.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I need to be more thorough. Need to put the time for a flowchart and psedocode.
Planning ahead before just diving into the project.
If I improve my time management I would become more organized.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this?
Everything was challenging since I am a beginner. 
I hope to retain everything I learned so I can become a successful in my career.

 What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The resources that were provide throughout the course have been very helpful.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Following the instructions and going back to the zybooks coursework allowed me to finish this project.
